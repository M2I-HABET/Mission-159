Because HAR's primary function is to communicate back to Mission Control and to manage other functions on the spacecraft, HAR only records data at 5 second intervals so that other clock cycles are used for other functions which have a higher priority. BERT on the other hand has the sole purpose of communicating it's position via satellite and that only happens around 3 minute intervals. The rest of the time it is idle. Due to that, BERT records data at 1 second intervals. \n",

        "The following graphs are from the Clue boards internal Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure sensors. HAR is located inside the spacecraft and is mostly shielded from direct light and the foam around the spacecraft does provide insulation.
